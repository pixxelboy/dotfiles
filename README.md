# My dotfiles, based on Roderik's dotfiles

This is a fork of Mathiasâ€™s dotfiles customised for my use.
Oh my, a fork of a fork ...

These dotfiles are fantastic, but basically, I felt the urge to tweak them a bit to fit my needs.

## Installation

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/Projects/dotfiles`, with `~/dotfiles` as a symlink.) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roderik/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh -f
```

### BASH 4

Some features depend on bash version 4. Install by running .brew

```bash
./.brew
```

### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```
